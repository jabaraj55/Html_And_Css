          The Jawa Jawa or Jawa 300 is a modern classic roadster with design which is near identical to the original Jawa two-stroke 250 cc motorcycles from the 1960s and '70s, although the new Jawa comes with a four-stroke 300 cc engine. Even though it's not a performance-oriented motorcycle, the Jawa looks great, is built well, and has brilliant ride and handling, backed by the performance of an engine which doesn't really have too many negatives.
